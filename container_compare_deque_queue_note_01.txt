n C++, both deque and queue are container adapters that provide a way to store and manipulate collections of elements.

deque stands for "double-ended queue," and it allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at both the beginning and the end of the sequence. It can be thought of as a dynamic array with optimized insertion and deletion at both ends. deque provides random access to its elements, which makes it a versatile container.

On the other hand, queue is a container adapter that provides a queue-like data structure, where elements are inserted at the back and removed from the front. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. queue does not provide random access to its elements, which makes it less versatile than deque.

In terms of functionality, deque is more powerful and flexible than queue. However, if you only need a simple queue-like container, queue is a better choice, since it provides a clearer and more intuitive interface.

Here's a summary of the key differences between deque and queue:

deque provides efficient insertion and deletion at both ends, while queue only provides insertion at the back and removal from the front.
deque provides random access to its elements, while queue does not.
deque is a more general-purpose container, while queue is designed specifically for implementing a queue data structure.
